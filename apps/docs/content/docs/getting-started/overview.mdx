# Architecture Overview

## Overview

These Pulumi packages provide reusable infrastructure components for deploying modern web applications on AWS. They automate the provisioning of Lambda, CloudFront, S3, and other AWS services needed for serverless web application hosting.

## Architecture

### Unified Deployment Components
Deploy any supported web framework to AWS with consistent, reusable infrastructure patterns:
- Next.js with full App Router and ISR support
- SvelteKit with SSR and static site generation
- React Router v7 with streaming and data loading

### Infrastructure as Code
Built on Pulumi for infrastructure management:
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible deployments
- Rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure testing

### Serverless Architecture
AWS serverless services that scale automatically:
- Pay only for actual usage
- No idle server costs
- Automatic scaling based on traffic
- Global edge distribution

## Key Components

### Core Infrastructure

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Compute** | Server-side rendering | AWS Lambda (ARM64) |
| **CDN** | Global content delivery | CloudFront |
| **Storage** | Static assets | S3 Buckets |
| **Database** | ISR cache (Next.js) | DynamoDB |
| **Queue** | Revalidation (Next.js) | SQS |
| **Monitoring** | Logs and metrics | CloudWatch |

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build Phase
Each framework has a custom adapter that:
- Analyzes your application structure
- Optimizes the build for serverless deployment
- Separates static and dynamic content
- Creates Lambda-ready bundles

### 2. Infrastructure Phase
Pulumi provisions AWS resources:
- Creates S3 buckets for static assets
- Deploys Lambda functions for SSR
- Configures CloudFront for global distribution
- Sets up monitoring and logging

### 3. Deployment Phase
The components:
- Upload static assets to S3
- Deploy Lambda functions
- Invalidate CloudFront cache
- Output application URL

## Key Features

### Infrastructure Management
- Customize any aspect of infrastructure
- Version control all infrastructure changes
- Debug with CloudWatch logs
- Direct AWS resource access

### Scalability
- Handle traffic spikes automatically
- Global performance with CloudFront
- Automatic capacity management

### Security
- Deployed to your AWS account
- IAM-based security controls
- VPC and private networking options
- Compliance-ready infrastructure

## Technology Stack

### Supported Frameworks
- **Next.js 14+**: React framework with ISR, App Router
- **SvelteKit 2+**: Svelte framework with SSR/SSG
- **React Router v7**: Modern routing with SSR

### AWS Infrastructure
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute with ARM64 support
- **CloudFront**: CDN and edge network
- **S3**: Object storage for static assets
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for ISR cache
- **IAM**: Security and access control

### Development Tools
- **Pulumi**: Infrastructure as Code engine
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe configuration
- **OpenNext**: Next.js adapter for AWS
- **Framework-specific adapters**: Custom build adapters for each framework
