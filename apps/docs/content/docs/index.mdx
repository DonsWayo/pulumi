### Terminology

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define and manage your infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. These packages use Pulumi for IaC.

**Stacks:** Isolated deployment environments (development, staging, production) with independent resources and configurations.

## Installation & Setup

A minimum version of Node.js 18+ is required (Node.js 22+ recommended).

1. Install Pulumi CLI:

```bash tab="brew"
brew install pulumi
```

```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g @pulumi/pulumi
```

2. Configure AWS credentials:

```bash
aws configure
# or export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

3. Install a deployment package:

```bash
# For Next.js
pnpm add -D @donswayo/pulumi-nextjs-aws

# For SvelteKit
pnpm add -D @donswayo/pulumi-sveltekit-aws

# For React Router
pnpm add -D @donswayo/pulumi-react-router-aws
```

### Your First Deployment

Create a Pulumi program and deploy:

Pulumi will:
- Detect your infrastructure requirements
- Build your application
- Provision AWS infrastructure
- Deploy to a CloudFront URL

Your application is now live on AWS with:
- Global CDN distribution
- Auto-scaling serverless functions
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure

Visit your CloudFront URL to see your deployed application.

```bash
https://[your-distribution].cloudfront.net
```
